    <marquee><h3 color=red>IMPORTANT : Read the terms and eligibility criteria carefully</h3></marquee>
<h1>Eligibility</h1>
Age: Donors are typically required to be within a certain age range, often between 16 to 65 years old. Some centers may allow 16-year-olds to donate with parental consent, while others might have an upper age limit of 60 or 65 years. This can vary based on local regulations and the policies of the specific donation center.VitalFlow allows age 21-65.
<br><br>
Weight: Donors usually need to meet a minimum weight requirement, which is commonly around 110 pounds (50 kilograms) or higher. This criterion helps ensure that the donor's body can safely handle the blood volume reduction during donation without causing adverse effects.
<br><br>
Health Conditions: Donors should generally be in good health at the time of donation. Certain health conditions or recent illnesses might disqualify a person from donating blood temporarily. Conditions like cold or flu symptoms, recent surgeries, infections, or specific chronic illnesses could impact eligibility.
<br><br>
Medications: Some medications might disqualify a person from donating blood due to their potential effects on the recipient. For example, certain blood thinners or medications with long half-lives might prevent donation. Donors are usually asked about their current medications during the screening process.
<br><br>
Travel History: Recent travel to certain regions or countries might defer a person from donating due to concerns about exposure to specific diseases prevalent in those areas, such as malaria or other infections.
<br><br>
Healthy Lifestyle: Individuals engaging in high-risk behaviors, such as intravenous drug use might be temporarily deferred from donating blood due to potential risks associated with these activities.
